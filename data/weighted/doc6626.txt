{"text": "This shows the main use of tangent and arctangent: converting between the two ways of telling the slant of a line, \"i.e.,\" angles and slopes. Therefore, in a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles total 90\u00b0 ( radians), so each of these angles must be in the range of as expressed in interval notation. The law of sines states that for an arbitrary triangle with sides \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" and angles opposite those sides \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\":\nThe radius of the circle is equal to the hypotenuse \"OP\", and has length 1, so we have and .
