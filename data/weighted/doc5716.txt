By 1868, the Plenty River hosted a self-sustaining population of brown trout which became a brood source for continued introduction of brown trout into Australian and New Zealand rivers. Scottish and Irish sea trout populations in recent years have seriously declined, possibly due to infestation by sea lice from salmon farms.\nThe only Canadian regions without brown trout are the Yukon and Northwest Territories. Moreover, in brown trout, as in many other fish species, a change in the diet composition normally occurs during the life of the fish, and piscivorous behaviour is most frequent in large brown trout. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u044b \u043e\u0442 \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u044e\u0433\u0435, \u0434\u043e \u041f\u0435\u0447\u043e\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435.
