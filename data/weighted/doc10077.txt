{"text": "Male rhesus macaques have not been observed to fight for access to sexually receptive females, although they suffer more wounds during the mating season. Rhesusapor blir upp till 30 \u00e5r gamla.\nFemale philopatry, common among social mammals, has been extensively studied in rhesus macaques. Genes for keratin, which produce hair shafts, were rapidly evolving in all three species, possibly because of climate change or mate selection. When food is abundant, they are distributed in patches, and forage throughout the day in their home ranges.

DNA from different branches of the primate tree will allow us \"to trace back the evolutionary changes that occurred at various time points, leading from the common ancestors of the primate clade to Homo sapiens,\" said Bruce Lahn, University of Chicago.\n", "metadata": [{"end": 154, "begin": 0, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 192, "begin": 154, "lang": "sv"}, {"end": 289, "begin": 192, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 433, "begin": 289, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 541, "begin": 433, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 598, "begin": 541, "lang": "sv"}, {"end": 613, "begin": 598, "lang": "my"}, {"end": 750, "begin": 613, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 845, "begin": 750, "lang": "my"}, {"end": 886, "begin": 845, "lang": "my"}, {"end": 930, "begin": 886, "lang": "sv"}, {"end": 1183, "begin": 930, "lang": "en"}]}
