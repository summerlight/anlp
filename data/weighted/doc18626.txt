For example, in Southern California, fuel must contain 2% oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6% ethanol in gasoline. Gasoline, as used worldwide in the vast number of internal combustion engines used in transport and industry, has a significant impact on the environment, both in local effects (e.g., smog) and in global effects (e.g., effect on the climate).

For technical reasons the use of leaded additives is still permitted world-wide for the formulation of some grades of aviation gasoline such as 100LL, because the required octane rating would be technically infeasible to reach without the use of leaded additives.\nThe lower energy content (per liter) of LPG in comparison to gasoline is due mainly to its lower density. In the US, octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 85 and 87 AKI (91-92 RON) for regular, through 89-90 AKI (94-95 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90-94 AKI (95-99 RON) for premium (European premium).\nEn malvarma vetero, tro malmulte ekvaporeco kauzas ke a\u016dtoj ne bone ekfunkcias.\nAlso, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which is by far the greater effect. Cars with turbocharged engines and high compression ratios often specify premium gas because higher octane fuels reduce the incidence of \"knock\", or fuel pre-detonation.\n", "metadata": [{"end": 63, "begin": 0, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 224, "begin": 63, "lang": "vi"}, {"end": 329, "begin": 224, "lang": "eo"}, {"end": 457, "begin": 329, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 700, "begin": 457, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 840, "begin": 700, "lang": "vi"}, {"end": 993, "begin": 840, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 1257, "begin": 993, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 1363, "begin": 1257, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 1601, "begin": 1363, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 1681, "begin": 1601, "lang": "eo"}, {"end": 1864, "begin": 1681, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 2034, "begin": 1864, "lang": "en"}]}
