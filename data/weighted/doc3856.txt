Siya ang nagkanonisa kay Thomas Aquinas.\nHe set up his residence in Avignon rather than Rome, continuing the Avignon Papacy of his predecessor.\nJohn XXII was neutral at first, but in 1323, when Louis IV became Holy Roman Emperor, the Guelph (papal) party and the Ghibelline (imperial) party quarreled, which was partly provoked by John XXII's extreme claims of authority over the empire and partly by Louis IV's support of the spiritual Franciscans, whom John XXII condemned in the Papal bull \"Quorumdam exigit\". Si Juan XXII ay naharap sa kontrobersiya sa kanyang teolohiya na kinasasangkutan ng kanyang mga pananaw sa Pangitaing Beatipiko at pagsalungat sa pagkaunawang Pransiskano ng pagiging dukha ni Kristo at mga apostol.
