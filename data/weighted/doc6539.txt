It was also called \"Lay Kyun Aung Myei\" (, , \"Victorious Land over the Four Islands\") and Mandalay Palace (, , \"Famed Royal Emerald Palace\").\n\u092f\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u0915\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f \u092c\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0930 \u091c\u0948\u0917\u094d\u092f\u094b \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u0915\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f \u092c\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0930 \u091c\u0948\u0917\u094d\u092f\u094b \u0939\u0948\u0964 Huge swaths of land left vacant by the fires were later purchased, mostly by the ethnic Chinese, many of whom were recent immigrants from Yunnan. To get around severe import limits, people of Mandalay have turned to illegally imported and hence unregistered (called \"without\" in Burmese English) motorcycles and cars despite the government's periodic confiscation sprees. Between the two World Wars, the city was Upper Burma's focal point in a series of nationwide protests against the British rule. The city has ten public hospitals and one hospital specializing in traditional Burmese medicine. \u1041\u1049\u1044\u1048 \u1001\u102f\u1014\u103e\u1005\u103a \u1021\u1004\u103a\u1039\u1002\u101c\u102d\u1015\u103a\u1010\u102d\u102f\u1037\u1011\u1036\u1019\u103e \u101c\u103d\u1010\u103a\u101c\u1015\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038 \u101b\u101b\u103e\u102d\u1001\u1032\u1037\u1015\u103c\u102e\u1038\u1014\u1031\u102c\u1000\u103a \u1019\u1014\u1039\u1010\u101c\u1031\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037\u101e\u100a\u1037\u103a \u101a\u1009\u103a\u1000\u103b\u1031\u1038\u1019\u103e\u102f\u104a ", "metadata": [{"end": 30, "begin": 0, "lang": "hi"}, {"end": 79, "begin": 30, "lang": "hi"}, {"end": 130, "begin": 79, "lang": "hi"}, {"end": 145, "begin": 130, "lang": "my"}, {"end": 323, "begin": 145, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 465, "begin": 323, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 496, "begin": 465, "lang": "hi"}, {"end": 527, "begin": 496, "lang": "hi"}, {"end": 673, "begin": 527, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 899, "begin": 673, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 1027, "begin": 899, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 1124, "begin": 1027, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 1211, "begin": 1124, "lang": "my"}]}
