It has a transitional climate between the oceanic climate of the Black Sea and a continental and Mediterranean climate. In 1555, Amasya was also the location for the signing of the Peace of Amasya with the Safavid dynasty of Persia.\n\u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0 (, ) \u2014 \u10e5\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10e5\u10d8 \u10e9\u10e0\u10d3\u10d8\u10da\u10dd\u10d4\u10d7 \u10d7\u10e3\u10e0\u10e5\u10d4\u10d7\u10e8\u10d8.
