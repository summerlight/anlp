Physical quantities can also be expressed using the SI prefix mega (M), when dealing with SI units; for example, 1 megawatt (1\u00a0MW) equals 1,000,000 watts.\nEven though it is often stressed that counting to precisely a million would be an exceedingly tedious task due to the time and concentration required, there are many ways to bring the number \"down to size\" in approximate quantities, ignoring irregularities or packing effects.\nIn scientific notation, it is written as or 10.
