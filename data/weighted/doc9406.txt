{"text": "Brachiopod shells occasionally show evidence of damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. Aunque se han descrito m\u00e1s de 16.000 especies f\u00f3siles, s\u00f3lo existen unas 335 especies actuales. However, some genera such as the inarticulate \"Crania\" and the articulate \"Lacazella\" have no pedicle, and cement the rear of the \"pedicle\" valve to a surface so that the front is slightly inclined up away from the surface.

However, some genera such as the inarticulate \"Crania\" and the articulate \"Lacazella\" have no pedicle, and cement the rear of the \"pedicle\" valve to a surface so that the front is slightly inclined up away from the surface. However, pterobranchs are hemichordates and probably closely related to echinoderms, and there is no evidence that the latest common ancestor of pterobranchs and other hemichordates or the latest common ancestor of hemichordates and echinoderms was sessile and fed by means of tentacles.\nLos braqui\u00f3podos (Brachiopoda, del griego \"brakh\u00fds\", \"corto\" y \"pod\u00f3s\", \"pie\") son un filo de animales marinos pertenecientes al clado de los lofoforados. The authors found this surprising, since nemertines have spiral cleavage in the early stages of cell division and form a trochophore larva, while brachiopods have radial cleavage and a larva that shows no sign of having evolved from a trochophore. The lophophore captures food particles, especially phytoplankton (tiny photosynthetic organisms), and deliver them to the mouth via the brachial grooves along the bases of the tentacles.\nUvnit\u0159 misek se d\u00e1le nach\u00e1zej\u00ed svaly, kter\u00e9 zav\u00edraj\u00ed misky (adduktory), svaly, kter\u00e9 misky otev\u00edraj\u00ed (diduktory) a kone\u010dn\u011b svaly, kter\u00e9 p\u0159ipev\u0148uj\u00ed stvol (adjustory).\n", "metadata": [{"end": 105, "begin": 0, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 217, "begin": 105, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 313, "begin": 217, "lang": "es"}, {"end": 537, "begin": 313, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 591, "begin": 537, "lang": "es"}, {"end": 757, "begin": 591, "lang": "cs"}, {"end": 929, "begin": 757, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 1153, "begin": 929, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 1441, "begin": 1153, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 1596, "begin": 1441, "lang": "es"}, {"end": 1844, "begin": 1596, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 2031, "begin": 1844, "lang": "en"}, {"end": 2197, "begin": 2031, "lang": "cs"}]}
