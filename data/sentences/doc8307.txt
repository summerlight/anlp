In the same year, in a letter to the compilers of the \"Biblioteca Italiana\" (Monti, Acerbi, Giordani), Leopardi argued against Madame de Sta\u00ebl's famous article inviting Italians to stop looking to the past and study the works of foreigners in order to reinvigorate their literature. \"All'Italia\" and \"Sopra il monumento di Dante\" marked the beginning of the series of major works. The humble plant of ginestra, living in desolate places without surrendering to the force of Nature, resembles this ideal man, who rejects any illusions about himself and does not invoke from Heaven (or Nature) an impossible help.\nUp until 1815, Leopardi was essentially an erudite philologist.
