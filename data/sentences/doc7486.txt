They are generally about 10 percent denser than steel, although alloys using aluminium or silicon may be slightly less dense. Archaeologists suspect that a serious disruption of the tin trade precipitated the transition. Sta\u010d\u00ed p\u0159\u00edsada n\u011bkolika setin procenta.

Bearings are often made of bronze for its friction properties. "}
