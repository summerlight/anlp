Underneath the thick atmospheres of the planets Uranus and Neptune, it is expected that these planets are composed of oceans of hot high-density fluid mixtures of water, ammonia and other volatiles. It covers 1/3 (one third) of the Earth's surface. The total mass of the hydrosphere is about 1.4 quintillion metric tons ( long tons or short tons), which is about 0.023% of Earth's total mass. Hot Neptunes close to their star could lose their atmospheres via hydrodynamic escape, leaving behind their cores with various liquids on the surface. "}
