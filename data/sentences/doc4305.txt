El Greco was highly esteemed as an architect and sculptor during his lifetime. Umumnya bagian lukisannya amat terang kontras dengan latarnya yang gelap.\nEl Greco also excelled as a portraitist, able not only to record a sitter's features but also to convey their character. To the English artist and critic Roger Fry in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best \"with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public\".
