We have not done extensive research on below topics because we think they have significant blockers to be selected. We'll explain about the reason, but we would like to ask your brief opinion about those topics.

## [SIGMORPHON 2016 Shared Task: Morphological Reinflection](http://ryancotterell.github.io/sigmorphon2016/)

We think this is good because it is a well-defined problem, a dataset and a baseline implementation are given so we can focus on solving a problem. Bad thing is that the given baseline is at state of the art level and extremely hard to beat. As we are not experts on computational morphology, it is very hard to estimate difficulty and feasibility of this task.

## [Predict closed questions on Stackoverflow](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-closed-questions-on-stack-overflow)

This is a kind of binary classification problem. It shares similar advantages with the above SIGMORPHON problem. The problem here is the size of data set. The languages other than English supported by Stackoverflow is like below:

* [Japanese](http://ja.stackoverflow.com/)
* [Portuguese](http://pt.stackoverflow.com/)
* [Espanol](http://es.stackoverflow.com/)
* [Russian](http://ru.stackoverflow.com/)

The size of each site is significantly smaller than the English site and we are not sure about whether we can derive meaningful results. But if using English data along with those languages is allowed, maybe we can make some interesting comparison between languages and size of datasets.

Moreover, since closing questions is highly subjective matter depending on the culture and the moderation of a corresponding site, objective evaluation could be hard.
